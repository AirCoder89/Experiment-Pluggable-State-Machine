Explore the capabilities of a fully customizable and independent Pluggable State Machine through this prototype. Designed from the ground up, this framework allows developers to plug in actions, decisions, and states via Scriptable Objects, creating a dynamic and versatile tool for managing AI behaviors.

## Project Overview

This prototype features NPC tanks that navigate a maze environment. The behavior of these tanks is controlled by a state machine which adjusts their actions based on environmental inputs:
- **Patrol**: Navigate through the maze following a set path.
- **Chase**: Seek out the player upon detection.
- **Attack**: Engage the player when within optimal range.

## Key Features

- **Fully Custom Framework**: Using Scriptable Objects, configure and modify behaviors, decisions, and states dynamically without modifying core system code.
- **Dynamic AI Behaviors**: Enable tanks to change behaviors based on gameplay, providing a rich and interactive player experience.

## System Components

The state machine consists of:
- **States**: What the AI is currently doing (e.g., patrolling, chasing).
- **Actions**: Tasks the AI performs while in a state (e.g., move to a point, look around).
- **Decisions**: Criteria that trigger transitions between states (e.g., player detected, health low).
